Bloodsuckers 1.1 (TrueType for Windows)...

...was hacked into existence by copying the title of a gruesome 50's cheapo horror comic and mad-doctoring the letters that
AREN'T in the words, "BLOOD-SUCKERS" into being.

Distribute it freely.  Widely.  Promiscuously.

All numbers and some punctuation are included, as well as five dingbat images:

Shift-6 - ^ ... 3 skulls

right paren - ) ... a zombie
bar - | ... a severed head
"At" sign - @ ... a bloody hand pointing right 
(Makes really cool "email addresses")

Bloodsuckers (the font) shouldn't do anything to harm your computer, but if it does, (EEYIKES!) I'm not responsible.  You're on your own.
